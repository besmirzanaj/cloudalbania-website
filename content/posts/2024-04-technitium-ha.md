## Introduction

[Technitium DNS Server](https://technitium.com/dns/) is a really interesting DNS server that you can use in your homelab. I have gone from [pi-hole ](https://pi-hole.net/) to [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) and while I really liked the minimalistic design and footprint of AdGuard Home, it had some issues when creating custom DNS records to use in a more advanced homelab scenario. The main painpoint for me was terraform integration. While there are both terraform plugins for [pihole](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ryanwholey/pihole/latest/docs/resources/dns_record) and [AdGuard Home](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gmichels/adguard/latest/docs/resources/user_rules) using them gave me stability issues in pihole and never working in AdGuard Home.

After looking for a new solution I found in a Reddit post about Technitium and that it is an open source authoritative as well as recursive DNS server.

In this article I am going to install technitium in a docker container as a primary DNS server and on a RaspberryPi as a backup DNS server. After settting these up, I will enable a `cron` job on the secondary DNS server to pull and sync the configurations from the primary DNS server periodically to keep them in sync.

## Prerequisites for Technitium DNS

Any recent OS should work. I am focusing on Linux systems in this article. Make sure to install `gzip` and `tar` beforehand as the installer script requires these packages.

You can install it as a systemd daemon (on a VM or a raspberrypi) or use the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. To use `docker` and `docker-compose` (or `podman`) you need to [install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) them first ([docker-compose install document](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)).

## Technitium installation procedure

For the sake of the examples, let's assume the primary server has an IP address `192.168.100.5` and hostname `dns01.home.arpa` and the secondary server (our raspberrypi) has an IP address `192.168.100.6` and hostname `dns02.home.arpa`.

NOTE: this article will not describe how to configure technitium.

### On the docker host

Let's create a `docker-compose.yml` file from the suggested git repo. I am using Technitium also as a DHCP server, so I need to configure docker network in `host` mode. I am using [`home.arpa`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8375.html) domain for the examples.

```yml filename=docker-compose.yml
name: technitium
services:
  dns-server:
    cpu_shares: 50
    container_name: dns-server
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
    hostname: dns-server
    image: technitium/dns-server:latest
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /local/data/path
        target: /etc/dns
    environment:
      - DNS_SERVER_DOMAIN=dns01.home.arpa
      - DNS_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
```

and thats it. Lets start our service now:

```console
[root@local-box technitium]# podman-compose up
podman-compose version: 1.0.6
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: 4.6.1
** excluding:  set()

```

An there you go. Now we can open the Technitium web UI and continue to configure it from there. To run this as a daemon, just add `-d` to your compose command.


### On the raspberry pi host

First make sure to not use the builtin system-resolved package as it will give you issues staring the server:

```console
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```

Then follow the [official guide](https://blog.technitium.com/2017/11/running-dns-server-on-ubuntu-linux.html) to install technitium. Basically:

```console
root@dns02.home.arpa:~# curl -sSL https://download.technitium.com/dns/install.sh | sudo bash
