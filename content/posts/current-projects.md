Hi everyone,  
We are currently working on OpenStack.org IaaS and performing test implementations.  
Current configurations include from an All-in-one server installation to a segregated and scaled implementation of multi-node server setup.  
The development of infrastructure includes integration of NAS, SAN storage, quantum network computing and Vyatta(r) router configurations to implement a fully integrated Cloud solution.  
Now we are looking for some more test implementations; if you are interested please contact us at: besmirzanaj@gmail.com.
