Last year I got a promo code for 50% off from the [Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/) [CKA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/) exam and also I really wanted to learn and probably deploy an environment at work for our dev teams to use.

As any new technology (at least for me), I just could not be satisfied with the ready to use K8S managed instances from the cloud providers ([GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), etc.) from a learning perspective.

The pain points for me after reading a high level architecture of K8s was how all was linked together, how to properly setup and automate the setup process for future builds and understand better the tooling.

In order to avoid to manually build/destroy/rebuild
